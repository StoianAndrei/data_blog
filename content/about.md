#### SOME CONTEXT

My name is Jason Dexter and I'm an `R-Programmer` and `Data-Analyst` based out of Berkeley, CA, where I live with my lovely wife 💃 and our two cats 🐈 🐈

In graduate school I was introduced to programming, first `base-R` and then `Python`. Programming was difficult for me at first, then I began to really resonate with the idea of solving problems programattically.

Now I'm a nerd 🤓 when it comes to automation and doing things programattically. There's something intoxicating about the process of wrangling data using code - it's simply amazing! 

I find emense satisfaction in determining the shape data needs to be in, then programatically crafting a solution to translate the raw-data into something useful.

Eventually I gravitated towards `R`, especially once I was introduced to the `Tidyverse` [by Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/). Matt has an online learning platform for Data Science that has been a real game-changer for me.

Check it out, it's called [Business Science Unviersity](http://bit.ly/2Z9SHsd).  


#### WHAT TO EXPECT

For now, posts will take an R-Centric approach to Wrangling + Exploring data. The posts will typically be bitesize with content that is applicable - my goal is to have the posts act as a library of useful tips + tricks for programmatically solving problems related to data.
